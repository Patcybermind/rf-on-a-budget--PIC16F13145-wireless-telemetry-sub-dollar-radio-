# Wireless on a budget

This project was built for microchip's configurable logic block design challenge and was published [here](https://maker.pro/configurable-logic-block/projects/wireless-on-a-budget)

It uses a PIC16f13145 curiosity nano dev board which is a dev board for a configurable logic bloc chip.

using no external hardware it transits digital data that can then be picked up and decoded on another radio.
